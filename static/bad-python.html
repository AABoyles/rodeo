    <h3>What's going on?</h3>
    <p class="small">
      Unfortunately Rodeo wasn't able to find the <code>python</code> command it needs in order
      to run. Rodeo uses the same libraries the IPython Notebook does. This means, if you don't
      have your notebook setup properly, Rodeo probably isn't going to work.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I fix it?</h3>
    <p class="small">
      The good news is that we've identified the problem and it's fairly easy to fix. The root
      of the problem is that you don't have Python setup correctly (or it's setup in a pretty non-standard
      way that Rodeo doesn't recognize). You've got a couple options.
    </p>

    <h3>The "I just want it to work" option</h3>
    <p class="small">
      If you just want this to work as quickly as humanly possible, you can install a pre-packaged version of Python.
      <br>
      The easiest way to go about this is to install <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>. It's free,
      you can double-click to install, and it has everything you need to use Rodeo.
      <br>
      Once you're done, try re-running Rodeo.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>The "I know what I'm doing" option</h3>
    <p class="small">
      Rodeo needs to be able to import either the <code>jupyter_client</code> or the <code>IPython</code> module. If you don't have
      one of these installed, then that's prboably your problem.
      <br>
      If you do have one of them installed, then the issue is that Rodeo is using the "wrong python". Rodeo defaults to using
      whatever <code>python</code> is on your PATH (or on Windows, whatever is set in your Environment Variables).
      <br />
      Not sure if you have python installed? You should probabyl go back to the "I just want it to work" section.

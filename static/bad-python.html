    <h2>Bad news! Rodeo can't start <i clas="fa fa-frown"></i></h2>
    <h3>What's going on?</h3>
    <p class="lead">
      Unfortunately Rodeo wasn't able to find the <code>python</code> command it needs in order
      to run. Rodeo uses the same libraries the IPython Notebook does. This means, if you don't
      have your notebook setup properly, Rodeo probably isn't going to work.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I fix it?</h3>
    <p class="lead">
      The good news is that this happens to a lot of people and it's fairly easy to fix. The root
      of the problem is that you don't have Python setup correctly (or it's setup in a pretty non-standard
      way that Rodeo doesn't recognize). You've got a couple options.
    </p>
    <h4>(1) The "I just want it to work" option</h4>
    <p class="lead">
      I recommend installing a pre-packaged version of Python. The following work pretty well:
      <ul>
        <li>Anaconda</li>
        <li>Another distro</li>
      </ul>
      Once you're done, try re-running Rodeo.
    </p>
    <h4>(2) The "I know what I'm doing" option</h4>
    <p class="lead">
      Rodeo attempts to load either of the following packages:

<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function() {
  require('ipc').on('ping', function(data) {
    console.log(data);
  });
